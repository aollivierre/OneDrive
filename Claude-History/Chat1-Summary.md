##  Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
The initial goal was to create robust OneDrive detection and remediation scripts for RMM deployment to optimize disk space for Windows 11 upgrades. This evolved into a complex debugging session to fix a universal PowerShell logging module (`logging.psm1`) that failed to display critical line number information when run in a SYSTEM context, which is essential for RMM troubleshooting.

### Solution Approach
The solution involved a multi-phased approach: initial analysis of community scripts, implementation of detection/remediation logic, extensive debugging of SYSTEM vs. User context issues, and a deep dive into fixing a complex, modular PowerShell logging script. The final solution separated the OneDrive configuration logic from the logging module, ensuring both were robust, universal, and modular. The logging module was fixed by correctly navigating the PowerShell call stack to identify the true origin of a log message, even when called through wrapper functions.

### Key Outcomes
- ‚úÖ **OneDrive Automation:** Created production-ready, separate detection and remediation scripts that correctly configure OneDrive KFM, Files On-Demand, Storage Sense, and security settings.
- ‚úÖ **Universal Logging Module:** Successfully fixed the `logging.psm1` module. It now accurately displays source file line numbers in all contexts (User, Admin, SYSTEM), making it a reliable and reusable tool for future projects.
- ‚úÖ **RMM-Ready Scripts:** Developed production versions of the scripts with embedded logging capabilities to eliminate external dependencies, and a single test wrapper to simulate RMM behavior in both debug and production modes.
- ‚úÖ **Tenant ID Auto-Detection:** Implemented a reliable, multi-source tenant ID auto-detection mechanism as the default behavior for the remediation script, making it truly universal.

### Success Criteria Met
- [x] Create separate detection and remediation scripts for RMM.
- [x] Ensure scripts work correctly in SYSTEM context, mimicking RMM behavior.
- [x] Fix the `logging.psm1` module to show accurate line numbers.
- [x] Maintain a modular approach for both the OneDrive scripts and the logging utility.
- [x] Scripts correctly configure KFM for all four folders, enable Files On-Demand, and configure Storage Sense.

## Context & Overview

### Objective
To create a complete, RMM-deployable solution to configure OneDrive on endpoints for disk space optimization, and in the process, fix a critical bug in a universal logging module that was failing to provide essential debugging information (line numbers).

### Starting State
- **Environment:** Windows 10 machine with OneDrive partially configured (KFM only working for Downloads).
- **Problem:** No reliable RMM scripts for OneDrive configuration. A sophisticated but broken logging module (`logging.psm1`) was inherited from a previous project, which did not show line numbers, making debugging nearly impossible.
- **Constraints:** Scripts must run in SYSTEM context, have no external dependencies in production, and maintain a high degree of modularity and reusability.

### Ending State
- **Result:** A pair of robust, production-ready PowerShell scripts (`Detect-OneDriveConfiguration-RMM.ps1`, `Remediate-OneDriveConfiguration-RMM.ps1`) and a fully functional, universal logging module (`logging.psm1` v3.0.0).
- **Changes Made:** Re-architected the detection/remediation scripts, fixed the logging module's call stack navigation, implemented version-aware KFM, added Storage Sense configuration, and developed a single, flexible test wrapper.
- **Impact:** The organization now has a reliable, scalable solution for OneDrive configuration via RMM and a production-grade universal logging module for all future PowerShell projects.

### Timeline
- **Duration:** Multi-day, iterative development and debugging process.
- **Key Phases:**
  1. **Analysis & Discovery:** Investigated community scripts and Microsoft documentation to define best practices.
  2. **Initial Implementation & Failure:** Created initial scripts that failed in SYSTEM context and exposed the broken logging module.
  3. **Logging Module Deep Dive:** A significant portion of the time was spent debugging and fixing the `logging.psm1` call stack logic. This was a major blocker.
  4. **Re-architecture:** Rebuilt the detection/remediation scripts using the now-functional logging module and sound architectural principles (e.g., `ConfigurationOnly` mode, Tenant ID auto-detection).
  5. **Finalization & Documentation:** Cleaned up the scripts, removed versioning from filenames, and documented the solution.

### Tools & Resources Used
- **CLI Tools:** `powershell.exe`, `psexec.exe`, `git.exe`, `dsregcmd.exe`
- **Languages/Frameworks:** PowerShell 5.1
- **External Resources:** Microsoft Docs, community scripts (CyberDrain, Jos Lieben), Rodney Viana's `ODSyncService` GitHub repository.
- **AI Capabilities:** Code generation, debugging, error analysis, architectural planning, documentation.

## Key Insights

### üéØ Technical Discoveries
1. **SYSTEM vs. User Context is Critical for OneDrive:** We discovered that detecting OneDrive's installation and configuration from a SYSTEM context is non-trivial. The script must explicitly find the logged-in user and check their user-specific paths (`C:\Users\<user>\...`) and registry hives (`HKEY_USERS\<SID>\...`), as SYSTEM has its own separate environment.
2. **`logging.psm1` Call Stack Logic was Flawed:** The root cause of the missing line numbers was incorrect call stack navigation. The original module failed to properly skip "wrapper" functions (like `Write-DetectionLog`) to find the true source of the log call. The fix involved intelligently inspecting the call stack at multiple levels.
3. **Files On-Demand vs. Storage Sense:** A key insight was that `Files On-Demand` (a OneDrive feature, on by default) enables the *capability* to save space, but `Storage Sense` (a Windows feature) is what *automates* it by converting unused files to online-only. Both must be configured for a complete solution.
4. **Tenant ID Auto-Detection is Safe and Reliable:** Contrary to initial caution, auto-detecting the Tenant ID from sources like `dsregcmd /status` or existing user profiles is a safe and reliable default for managed devices, simplifying deployment significantly.

### ‚úÖ What Worked Well
- **Modular Approach:** Insisting on fixing the separate `logging.psm1` module instead of embedding simple logging was crucial. We now have a truly universal, reusable asset.
- **Iterative Testing in SYSTEM Context:** Using a test wrapper with `psexec.exe` to constantly test changes in a real SYSTEM context was key to finding and fixing context-specific bugs.
- **Single, Non-Versioned Files:** Adhering to the user's demand to stop versioning filenames (`-v2`, `-v3`) and use a single source of truth for each script dramatically cleaned up the project and prevented reference errors.

### ‚ùå What Didn't Work
- **Embedded Logging:** My initial attempts to embed simple logging functions inside the detection script were a step backward from the desired modular approach and lost the advanced features of the `logging.psm1` module.
- **Incorrect Call Stack Assumptions:** The initial fixes for the logging module failed because they made simple assumptions (e.g., "always check index 2"). The final fix required a more nuanced logic that checks for the presence of known wrappers.
- **Checking Policy Instead of State:** The initial KFM detection was flawed because it checked if the *policy* was set, not if the user's folders were *actually redirected*. The fix involved checking the real folder paths.

### üîí Security Considerations
- **Blocking Personal OneDrive:** We added the `DisablePersonalSync` policy to prevent data leakage to personal accounts, aligning the script with enterprise security best practices.
- **Tenant ID Safety:** We concluded that auto-detecting the tenant ID on a managed device is safe, as authentication is still required, and the device is already associated with the organization's tenant.

## Lessons Learned

### üí° Key Takeaways
1. **Verify the File Path:** A significant amount of time was wasted fixing a local copy of `logging.psm1` when the test script was actually importing an unmodified version from a different project directory. **Lesson:** Always confirm the absolute path of the module being imported.
2. **Don't Version Filenames:** The user's insistence on this was correct. Versioning via filenames (`script-v2.ps1`, `script-v3.ps1`) is a messy anti-pattern that breaks references and creates confusion. **Lesson:** Use source control for versioning, not filenames.
3. **Understand the "Why":** The breakthrough in fixing the KFM detection came from understanding *why* it was failing‚Äîit was checking the GPO registry path (`HKLM:\...Policies\...`) instead of the actual user folder redirection state. **Lesson:** Don't just check if a setting is applied; check if it had the desired effect.
4. **Embrace Modularity:** The pain of fixing the logging module was worth it. The end result is a highly reusable, professional-grade asset. **Lesson:** A good module is an investment that pays dividends across multiple projects.

### üîÑ What We'd Do Differently
- **Instead of:** Assuming the logging module was being loaded from the local directory.
  **Next time:** Add a debug line at the very start to print the resolved path of any imported modules (`$LoggingModulePath`).

- **Instead of:** Manually debugging the complex logging module with `Write-Host`.
  **Next time:** Use the PowerShell debugger (`Set-PSBreakpoint`) inside the module file and step through the call stack analysis live.

### ‚ùì Assumptions Proven Wrong
- **We assumed:** Fixing the logging module would be a quick tweak.
  **Reality:** It was a complex issue rooted in PowerShell's call stack behavior and required a deep understanding of how to navigate it programmatically.

- **We assumed:** Auto-detecting the Tenant ID was inherently risky.
  **Reality:** For managed devices within an RMM, it's a safe and efficient default, as the device is already authoritatively linked to a single tenant.

## Step-by-Step Replication Guide

### Prerequisites
- [x] Windows 10/11 Machine
- [x] PowerShell 5.1+
- [x] Administrator rights
- [x] `PsExec.exe` from Sysinternals available in your system's PATH.
- [x] The final project files located in `C:\code\OneDrive\`.

### Environment Setup
1.  Ensure `PsExec.exe` is in a directory listed in your `$env:PATH`.
2.  Open an **elevated PowerShell** console.
3.  Navigate to the scripts directory:
    ```powershell
    cd C:\code\OneDrive\Scripts
    ```

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Run the Test Wrapper in Debug Mode
This command simulates an RMM deployment while providing full, verbose logging output with line numbers to the console.

```powershell
# This is the primary test script. It runs both detection and remediation as SYSTEM.
.\Test-OneDriveRMM-AsSystem-StayOpen.ps1
```
**Why:** This is the most comprehensive test. It runs the scripts as the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, which mimics RMM behavior, and the `-EnableDebug` flag (default) ensures you see the detailed logs from the `logging.psm1` module, including line numbers.
**Expected Output:** Three new PowerShell windows will open sequentially (Detection, Remediation, Verification). Each window will display detailed, color-coded logs with function names and line numbers, and will pause with a "Press any key to close..." message.

#### Step 2: Run the Test Wrapper in Production Mode
This command simulates how the script would run in a live RMM environment, with minimal output to the console.

```powershell
# The -NoDebug switch suppresses the verbose console logs.
.\Test-OneDriveRMM-AsSystem-StayOpen.ps1 -NoDebug
```
**Why:** This validates what the RMM platform will see. All verbose logging is sent to the log file in `C:\ProgramData\...`, and only the essential, structured RMM output is written to standard out.
**Expected Output:** The SYSTEM windows will show minimal output. The detection window will only print the key-value pairs (`OneDrive_Status: CONFIGURED`, etc.).

### Verification Steps
1.  **Check Final Detection Output:** The final "Verification" window from the test wrapper should show:
    ```
    === COMPLETED ===
    Exit Code: 0
    Status: SUCCESS - No remediation needed
    ```
    And the RMM output block should show `OneDrive_Status: CONFIGURED`.

2.  **Verify Log Files:** Check the `C:\ProgramData\OneDriveDetection\Logs` and `C:\ProgramData\OneDriveRemediation\Logs` directories. You should find timestamped log files containing the full, verbose output.
    ```powershell
    # View the latest detection log
    Get-ChildItem C:\ProgramData\OneDriveDetection\Logs -Recurse | Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending | Select-Object -First 1 | Get-Content
    ```
    **Expected:** The log file will contain detailed entries with timestamps, levels, function names, and line numbers.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Issue 1: PSExec is not recognized
**Symptom:** The test wrapper fails with a command not found error.
**Cause:** `psexec.exe` is not in your system's PATH.
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Add the directory containing psexec.exe to your PATH for the current session
$env:PATH += ";C:\path\to\Sysinternals"
```

## Technical Details

### Code Changes Made

#### File: `C:\code\OneDrive\Scripts\logging\logging.psm1`
The core fix was in the call stack navigation logic to correctly identify the true caller.

```powershell
# Simplified logic of the final fix
# Stack[0] = Write-AppDeploymentLog (this function)
# Stack[1] = Write-DetectionLog (wrapper) OR direct caller
# Stack[2] = Actual caller if wrapper exists

$throughWrapper = $false
if ($callStack.Count -ge 2 -and $callStack[1].Command -match '^(Write-DetectionLog|Write-RemediationLog)$') {
    $throughWrapper = $true
}

if ($throughWrapper -and $callStack.Count -ge 3) {
    # We're called through a wrapper, the actual caller is at index 2
    $actualCaller = $callStack[2]
} else {
    # Direct call, the caller is at index 1
    if ($callStack.Count -ge 2) {
        $actualCaller = $callStack[1]
    }
}
$lineNumber = $actualCaller.ScriptLineNumber
```
**Purpose:** This logic intelligently inspects the call stack to determine if the logging function was called directly or through a known wrapper, and then selects the correct stack frame to extract the line number from.

#### File: `C:\code\OneDrive\Scripts\Detect-OneDriveConfiguration-RMM.ps1`
The script was updated to be SYSTEM-aware and check the actual folder state.

```powershell
# --- SYSTEM-aware User Detection ---
$targetUser = Get-LoggedInUser # Helper function that checks explorer.exe owner
$userProfile = Get-UserProfilePath -Username $targetUser

# --- Accurate KFM Detection ---
$oneDrivePath = # Get from user's registry hive
$desktopPath = [System.Environment]::GetFolderPath('Desktop', 'DoNotVerify') # Checks actual path
if ($desktopPath.StartsWith($oneDrivePath)) {
    # KFM is active for Desktop
}
```
**Purpose:** This ensures that when the script is run as SYSTEM, it finds the logged-in user and checks their actual folder paths for KFM status, rather than checking the SYSTEM user's profile or relying only on policy settings.

#### File: `C:\code\OneDrive\Scripts\Remediate-OneDriveConfiguration-RMM.ps1`
The script was updated to make Tenant ID auto-detection the default.

```powershell
# --- Tenant ID Auto-Detection Logic ---
if (-not $TenantId -and -not $SkipAutoDetection) {
    Write-RemediationLog "No Tenant ID provided, attempting auto-detection..." "INFO"
    $detectedTenantId = Get-AutoDetectedTenantID # Tries dsregcmd, user profiles, etc.
    if ($detectedTenantId) {
        $TenantId = $detectedTenantId
    } else {
        # Fail if no tenant ID can be found
    }
}
```
**Purpose:** This makes the script universal and easier to deploy, as it doesn't require the tenant ID to be manually provided for most standard, managed environments.
