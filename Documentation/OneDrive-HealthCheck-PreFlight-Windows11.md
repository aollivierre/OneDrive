# OneDrive Health Check for Windows 11 Pre-Flight
## Documentation for Future Implementation

### Purpose
Pre-flight validation to ensure OneDrive is in a healthy state before Windows 11 upgrade to prevent data loss.

### Validated Approach (DMU-Style)
Using the proven SYSTEM-to-user context switching pattern with Rodney Viana's OneDrive status tools.

### Architecture
```
SYSTEM Context (RMM)
    ↓
Creates Scheduled Task
    ↓
User Context Execution
    ↓
OneDriveLib.dll / ODSyncUtil.exe
    ↓
JSON Status File
    ↓
SYSTEM Reads Results
```

### Status Categories
**Safe for Upgrade:**
- `Synced` / `UpToDate` / `Up To Date` - All files are safely in cloud

**Unsafe for Upgrade:**
- `Syncing` / `SharedSync` - Active sync, files may be lost
- `Error` / `ReadOnly` / `Paused` - Sync issues, files at risk
- `OnDemandOrUnknown` - Cannot determine safety

### Implementation Notes
1. Use `Test-OneDriveValidation-DMU-Style.ps1` as base
2. Use `Collect-OneDriveStatus-Adaptive.ps1` for OS compatibility
3. Return simple boolean: $true (safe) or $false (unsafe)
4. Log detailed status for troubleshooting

### Key Scripts Created
- `C:\code\OneDrive\Scripts\Test-OneDriveValidation-DMU-Style.ps1` - SYSTEM orchestrator
- `C:\code\OneDrive\Scripts\Collect-OneDriveStatus-Adaptive.ps1` - User context collector
- `C:\code\OneDrive\Scripts\Get-OptimalOneDriveLibVersion.ps1` - OS version detection

### Tested Working Output
```
OneDrive Status: HEALTHY (Synced)
Sync Folders:
  C:\Users\administrator\OneDrive - Exchange Technology Services: Synced
```

This approach is validated and working for future Windows 11 pre-flight checks.
